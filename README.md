# Hello World! I'm Bryce ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my digital sandbox! I'm a full-time student at the University of Portland, diving
headfirst into the world of computer science. Programming has become my passion, allowing me
to conjure up creations and possibilities that once seemed like figments of my imagination.
When I'm not tapping away at my keyboard, you can find me exercising at the gym, hiking scenic
trails, or catching up with friends and family.

Connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brycekwon/">LinkedIn</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/brycekwon/">GitHub</a> to follow my journey into the digital realm.
If you'd like to contact me, <a href="mailto:contact@brycekwon.dev">email</a> is my preferred
method of communication. Feel free to ask me anything about my current projects, cybersecurity,
digital privacy, or just to say hello!
